### Notes
"Thread 1: signal SIGABRT", When I try to run this app on my iphone.
And ERROR:
/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/8C0DD525-AACE-4FFC-B97C-A3273A04229F/Flix-week1.app/Frameworks/Alamofire.framework/Alamofire: stat() failed with errno=1 /private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/8C0DD525-AACE-4FFC-B97C-A3273A04229F/Flix-week1.app/Frameworks/Alamofire.framework/Alamofire: code signature invalid for '/private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/8C0DD525-AACE-4FFC-B97C-A3273A04229F/Flix-week1.app/Frameworks/Alamofire.framework/Alamofire'

Finally, I have connected to IOS 12, and it works! And there some changes for version 12. I should add "@available(iOS 13.0, *)" at AppDelegate.swift and SceneDelegate.swift. Also add "var window: UIWindow?" at AppDelegate.swift and SceneDelegate.swift.
